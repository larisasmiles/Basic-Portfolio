        <p>I think of myself as abosolutely WONDERFUL! We all should right? Creativity has always been an adjective people like
          to use when describing me. What do you know, I like to use that one too! I watch movies and think of ways that
          the director droped the ball, I look at websites and see all the area's I would fix. I am a creator of things and
          children! I have two beautifully made children ages 6 and 5. They're energy and wisdom keep my brain ticking the
          way I like it to. I enjoy the art of collarboration on many different levels. I am currently expanding my brain
          at DU's coding bootcamp. Contact me and I can tell you all about it!
