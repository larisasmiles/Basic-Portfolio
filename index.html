    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I think of myself as abosolutely WONDERFUL! We all should right? Creativity has always been an adjective people like to use
      when describing me. What do you know, I like to use that one too! I watch movies and think of ways that the director droped the ball, I look
      at websites and see all the area's I would fix. I am a creator of things and children! I have two beautifully made children
      ages 6 and 5. They're energy and wisdom keep my brain ticking the way I like it to. I enjoy the art of collarboration on many different 
      levels. I am a great listener and an even better oraganizer. At least that's what "they" say.
